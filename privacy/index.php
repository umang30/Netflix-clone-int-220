<br />
<b>Use of Information</b><br />
We use information to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts, to manage member referrals, to process your registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and other topics. For example, we use such information to:
<br/>
<br />

        determine your general geographic location, provide localized content, provide you with customized and personalized viewing recommendations for movies and TV shows we think will be of interest to you, determine your ISP to support network troubleshooting for you (we also use aggregated ISP information for operational and business purposes), and help us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests;
    </li>

    <br />
    <li>

Please see the "Your Choices" section of this Privacy Statement to learn how to set or change your communications preferences.
    </li>
    <br />
</ul>
Our recommendations system strives to predict what you will be in the mood to watch when you log in. However, our recommendations system does not infer or attach socio-demographic information (like gender or race) to you. We have a Help article that explains how our recommendations system works - spoilers: the biggest driver of recommendations is what you actually choose to watch through our service. You can read the article at <a href="https://www.netflix.com/recommendations" class="links">www.netflix.com/recommendations</a>.

<br />
<b>
Disclosure of Information
</b>
<br/>
<br />
We disclose your information for certain purposes and to third parties, as described below:
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>The Netflix family of companies:</b> We share your information among the Netflix family of companies (<a href="/int220/corpinfo/" class="links">help.netflix.com/legal/corpinfo</a>) as needed for: providing you with access to our services; providing customer support; making decisions about service improvements; content development; and for other purposes described in the Use of Information section of this Privacy Statement.

    <br />
    <li>
        <b>Service Providers:</b> We use other companies, agents or contractors ("Service Providers") to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you.

    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
        <b>Partners:</b> As described above, you may have a relationship with one or more of our Partners, in which case we may share certain information with them in order to coordinate with them on providing the Netflix service to members and providing information about the availability of the Netflix service. For example, depending on what Partner services you use, we may share information:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul class="circle">
            <li>
                in order to facilitate Partner pre-paid promotions or collection of payment for the Netflix service for distribution to us;
            </li>
            <br />

            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                so that content and features available in the Netflix service can be suggested to you in the Partner’s user interface. For members, these suggestions are part of the Netflix service and may include customized and personalized viewing recommendations.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
        <b>Promotional offers:</b> We may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for your participation, will require us to share your information with third parties. In fulfilling these types of promotions, we may share your name and other information in connection with fulfilling the incentive. Please note that these third parties are responsible for their own privacy practices.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
        <b>Protection of Netflix and others:</b> Netflix and its Service Providers may disclose and otherwise use your personal and other information where we or they reasonably believe such disclosure is needed to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal activities (including payment fraud), security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Netflix, its users or the public, as required or permitted by law.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
        <b>Business transfers:</b> In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transfer of assets, we will transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Statement.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Whenever in the course of sharing information we transfer personal information to other countries we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Statement and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection.
<br />
<br />
You may also choose to disclose your information in the following ways:
<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        certain portions of our service may contain a tool which gives you the option to share information by email, text message and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and applications on your smart device;
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
        social plugins and similar technologies allow you to share information; and
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
        through Netflix game features, such as multiplayer options and leaderboards.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Social plugins and social applications are operated by the social networks themselves, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies. Similarly, some of the Netflix game features mentioned above (such as multiplayer gameplay, leaderboards, and game saving options) may require use of a third-party service, which is subject to that service’s terms of use and privacy policy.
<br />
<br />
<b>
Access to Account and Profiles
</b>
<br/>
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
       <b>“Remember me” function:</b> For ease of access to your account, you can use the "Remember me on this device" function when you log in to the website. This function uses technology that enables us to provide direct account access and to help administer the Netflix service without requiring reentry of any password or other user identification when your browser revisits the service. 
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
        <b>Giving others access to your account:</b> If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they will be able to see shows you have watched, ratings, account information (including your email address or other information in the "Account" area of our website), and game related information (such as your in-game name and saved game progress). This remains true even if you use our profiles feature. You might have the option to use seamless account login through the Netflix mobile app, which enables login to the Netflix app on smart TVs, set top boxes, and other streaming media devices on the Wi-Fi network to which you are connected. If you use that feature, those devices will remain signed into your account unless you later log out of those devices.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
        <b>Profiles:</b> Profiles allow users to have a distinct, personalized Netflix experience, built around the movies and shows of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are available to everyone who uses your Netflix account, so that anyone with access to your Netflix account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles. You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not wish them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number or other information to the profile and will be provided with notice of collection and use at the time such information is requested (the Profile Privacy Notice applies (<a href="https://help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy" class="links">help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy</a>)). We have various parental controls available, you can learn more by reading our Help article located at <a href="https://help.netflix.com/node/264" class="links">https://help.netflix.com/node/264</a>.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
        <b>Removing device access to your Netflix account:</b> To remove access to your Netflix account from your devices, visit the "Account" section of our website, choose "Sign out of all devices," and follow the instructions to deactivate your devices (note, deactivation may not occur immediately). Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a computer or Netflix ready device, you should log out and deactivate the device before doing so. If you do not maintain the security of your password or device, or fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your account, including your personal information.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>
Your Choices
</b>
<br/>
<b>Email and Text Messages.</b> If you no longer want to receive certain communications from us via email or text message, simply access the "Communications Settings" option in the "Account" section of our website and uncheck those items to unsubscribe. Alternatively, click the "unsubscribe" link in the email or reply STOP (or as otherwise instructed) to the text message. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from service-related correspondence from us, such as messages relating to your account transactions.
<br />
<br />
<b>Push Notifications.</b> You can choose to receive mobile push notifications from Netflix. On some device operating systems, you will be automatically enrolled in the notifications. If you subsequently decide you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device's settings functionality to turn them off. We also offer push notifications on certain web browsers. If you agree to receive those notifications and subsequently decide you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can use your browser’s settings to turn them off.
<br />
<br />
<b>WhatsApp.</b> If you have enabled WhatsApp messages in connection with your Netflix account or profile and no longer wish to receive them, you can use your WhatsApp app settings to block them.
<br />
<br />
<b>Interest-Based Ads.</b> Interest-based ads are online ads that are tailored to your likely interests based on your use of various apps and websites across the Internet. If you are using a browser, then cookies and web beacons can be used to collect information to help determine your likely interests. If you are using a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device that includes a resettable device identifier, then that identifier can be used to help determine your likely interests. For your choices about interest-based ads from Netflix, please see the "Cookies and Internet Advertising" section (below).
<br />
<br />
<b>Matched Identifier Communications.</b> Some third party sites and apps allow us to reach our users with online promotions about our titles and services by sending a privacy protective identifier to the third party. A privacy protective identifier means we convert the original information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares the privacy protective identifier to identifiers in its database and there will be a match only if you have used the same identifier (such as an email address) with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send a given promotional communication to you on that third party site or app, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of online advertising. You can opt out in the “Marketing Communications” section of the “Account” section of our website.
<br />
<br />
<b>Your Information and Rights</b>
<br/>
You can request access to your personal information, or correct or update out-of-date or inaccurate personal information we hold about you. You may also request that we delete personal information that we hold about you.
<br />
<br />
When you visit the "Account" portion of our website, where you have the ability to access and update a broad range of information about your account, including your contact information, your Netflix payment information, and various related information about your account (such as the content you have viewed and rated). You must be signed in to access the "Account" section.

<br />
<br />
For other requests, or if you have a question regarding our privacy practices, please contact our Data Protection Officer/Privacy Office at <a href="mailto:privacy@netflix.com" class="links">privacy@netflix.com</a>. For more information about how to access your information, including our verification process, please reference this help article:  <a href="https://help.netflix.com/node/100624" class="links">help.netflix.com/node/100624</a>.

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Please also see the "Your Choices" section of this Privacy Statement for additional choices regarding your information.
<br />
<br />
We may reject requests that are unreasonable or not required by law, including those that would be extremely impractical, could require disproportionate technical effort, or could expose us to operational risks such as free trial fraud. We may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records purposes and to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. We take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required.
<br />
<br />
<b>Security</b>
<br/>
We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and modification. These measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information.
<br />
<br />
<b>Other Websites, Platforms and Applications</b>
<br />
The Netflix service may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as voice controls) operated by third party platforms, or contain links to sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of information may differ from ours. For example, you may be able to access the Netflix service through platforms such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes and a number of other Internet connected devices. These websites and platforms have separate and independent privacy or data policies, privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. In addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with the Netflix service.
<br />
<br />
<b>Children</b>
<br />
You must be at least 18 years of age or older to subscribe to the Netflix service. Minors may only use the service with the involvement, supervision, and approval of a parent or legal guardian.
<br />
<br />
<b>Changes to This Privacy Statement</b>
<br />
We will update this Privacy Statement from time to time in response to changing legal, regulatory or operational requirements. We will provide notice of any such changes (including when they will take effect) in accordance with law. Your continued use of the Netflix service after any such updates take effect will constitute acknowledgement and (as applicable) acceptance of those changes. If you do not wish to acknowledge or accept any updates to this Privacy Statement, you may cancel your use of the Netflix service. To see when this Privacy Statement was last updated, please see the "Last Updated" section below.
<br />
<br />
<b>Cookies and Internet Advertising</b>
<br />
We and our Service Providers use cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons), as well as resettable device identifiers, for various reasons. We want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so this section explains the types of technologies we use, what they do, and your choices regarding their use. 
<br />
<br />
<b>Cookies and similar technologies, web beacons, and resettable device identifiers</b>
<br />
<br />
Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services. We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.
<br />
<br />
If you use the Netflix app on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the "Identifier for Advertisers" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant and for analytics and optimization purposes.   
<br />
<br />
<b>Why does Netflix use these technologies?</b>
<br />
<br />
We use these types of technologies for various reasons, like making it easy to access our services by remembering you when you return; to provide, analyze, understand and enhance the use of our services; to enforce our terms, prevent fraud; to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site; and to deliver and tailor our marketing or advertising, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and online ads on third party sites.  
<br />
<br />
To help you better understand how we use cookies and resettable device identifiers, please see the information below:
<br />
<br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Essential cookies:</b> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service. For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service. 
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <b>Performance and functionality cookies:</b> These cookies help us to customize and enhance your online experience with Netflix. For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research. Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <b>Advertising cookies and resettable device identifiers:</b> These cookies and resettable device identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you and for analytics and optimization purposes. These types of ads are called "interest-based advertising." The advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers. 
        </li>
    </ul>
<br />
In connection with our use of these technologies, some of the websites and apps where we advertise, as well as advertising technology companies that we use to purchase, deliver, optimize, and/or measure our advertisements (collectively “Advertising Partners”), may receive limited information from us as part of our campaign targeting, measurement, and optimization (e.g., steps completed in sign-up and site visit or app open/install information).
<br />
<br />
Common uses of this type of information are to judge the effectiveness of and optimize ad campaigns, by allowing Advertising Partners to see when someone who saw an ad later signed up for our service.  Another common use is to make sure we do not serve ads trying to get individuals to sign up for the Netflix service if they are already a Netflix user.  
<br />
<br />
Netflix uses contractual and technical measures designed to prevent Advertising Partners from accessing information regarding specific title selections you make, URLs you land on, or shows you have watched on our service. We do not share information about title selections or your shows you have watched on our service.  
<br />
<br />
<b>How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies? </b>

<b>To exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers</b>
<br />
<br />
To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with a resettable device identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings). You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests.

<br />
<b>To exercise choice regarding other technologies</b>
<br />
<br />
There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area; see your browser's help function or support area to learn more. Other technologies, such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.
